## Kubernetes Objects: Pod

- Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.​
  <br/>
- A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. ​
  <br/>
- For running: `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`
  <br/>
- For deleting: `kubectl delete -f pod.yaml`
